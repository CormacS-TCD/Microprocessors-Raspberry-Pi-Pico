Single-precision runtime on single-core: 0.595 seconds
Double-precision runtime on single-core: 1.047 seconds
Total application runtime on single-core: 1.642 seconds

Single-precision runtime on multi-core: 0.595 seconds
Double-precision runtime on multi-core: 1.047 seconds
Total application runtime on multi-core: 1.047 seconds

When running the functions on a single-core, the individual function 
runtimes added up to form the total application runtimes. This is to 
be expected when running them sequentially. 

However, when running the functions on both cores in parallel, the 
individual runtimes do not add up to for the total application runtime.
The longest of the two runtimes forms the total application run time, 
which is to be expected when you think above a multi-core process. 

Assuming each function began running at the same time, they ran in parallel.
This means that the application runtime is when either both functions end 
at the same time, or when the longer one ends. Hence, the total application
runtime is recorded as the longest runtime of the two functions.
